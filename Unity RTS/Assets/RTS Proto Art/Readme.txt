First, thank you for making a purchase!

contact: endboss@gmail.com (I don't alwasy check email but I do check the reviews)

Update 10-07-2018:
- added Mech Unit
- added Titan Unit
- added rifle for Mech Unit
- added 4 anim clips for use with Mech Unit
- added 2 new buildings

Using Mixamo Animations:
- Make an account on Mixamo
- Once your account is setup, use the "UPLOAD CHARACTER" option
- From there just drag the provided Mixamo ready rig in the FBX folder of the project > "MiechUnitMixamoRigBlue"
- Now just download the animations you need for your project

Limitations of Mixamo:
- You will quickly see not all the animations will work perfectly.  These are just the limitations of Mixamo
-- I've provided 4 anim clips that are tweaked from Mixamo shooting animations
-- If you need more animations I suggest you get UMotion Pro from the Asset Store, or wait for me to make more updates
-- Write a review and request what you need, but it's no guarantee......just look how long this update took ;)
